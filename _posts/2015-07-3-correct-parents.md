title: Correct Parents
---

Fiction presents a limitless opportunity for vindication. Characters can be prophetic absolutely. As a child of someone, as one is, the possibility of correct parents 

Even if they don't say anything, parents set traps for us. We slip, we jump to conclusions

Psychologist parents are in fiction the most stunning examples of impotent parents. That they have such extensive professional knowledge over human nature leaves them uniquely blind to their children, or their very normal blindness becomes uniquely ironic. Their often outlandish misunderstandings of their children are aggressive, even murderous. Amy's parents in *Gone Girl* are vampires, making a living off of who they somehow both believe and wish their daughter to be--*Amazing Amy*.

Rachel's mother is a different kind of monster, one who believes (or wishes?) her daughter suffers from some nebulous mental illness, one that only she can diagnose and treat. Does a child under such egregious misrecognition judge herself by the nearly non-sequitor criteria of her mother? What kind of monster writes such an easily written off figure?

Someone like Quinn, I think, whose job is to set up the little universe of a reality show like dominos, so that the truths about human nature she believes will reveal themselves again and again. To write fiction is to bring something into the world, have it at your complete mercy, and yet hope that it gets away from you. The irony (and tension) of the show is that Quinn's show is successful because it's always getting away from her. Her protege, Rachel, works from a different theory of the world, less antiquated, less cruel, and uses it to tear holes in Quinn's show. But the holes are quickly stitched back together into products, stunning products, the only bits of life in a worn, tired fabric.

But there's something cynical even about the show's cyninicsm. The show's contestants lie just below the intended audience's understanding of sexism and racism. One lets her racism show through a well-worn cliche, "I really do have lots of black friends." The intended viewer doesn't have to think about why this is problematic (ugh that word), it's a box checked. Quinn's criteria for good TV read like a twitter feed of outrage: The writers of UnREAL believe in a producer who believes in an audience who believe sluts must be shamed, black women must be angry, women with hook noses must not marry. Upworthy is the other side of the same coin, the same set of sociological truisms that every escape from is an occasion for wonder and hope.

Television consists of various traps. As Emily Nussbaum points out, the third season of *Hannibal* figures your viewing of the show in the show. It's easy to think, then, that it's the show Bedelia is speaking to when she says "I feel in control of my own actions, which, given your history, is a good day." *Hannibal* is beautiful show about aesthetics. "What have you gotten yourself into, Bedelia?"

![The whole screen's a trap.]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/img/hannibal_screen_trap.png)

"Elegance is more important than suffering." (Will) My, it just keeps going.

s3 focus on memory, hannibal obsessively feeding one killing into the other, literally, the chain never broken, through preserved meat if necessary. except for bedelia who eats "oysters, acorns, and marsala, what the ancient romans fed livestock to make the meat tastier"

s3 is, true to hannibal's ever-mounting aesthetic fervor, is dense with wit (ha): punch romaine, "served to first class guests on the titanic during their last dinner," for roman's last dinner, during which he is punched, punched through.

bedlia's constant sardonic double entendres

e04 alana's bed & convalescent outfit (a strip of bandage on her breasts and around her hips). really? everything about this episode is boring and pointless.

"toddler-level reverse psychology"

"who knew horse-face was going to be a crowd favorite?" the writers of unreal?

of all the immoral things to create "good tv" on unreal, messing with her meds bothers me the most

i don't know about this whole rachel bringing faith into the light of undertanding her own sexual identity. it's like it exists for rachel to have a teary moment, like straight people posting rainbow selfie after the supreme court ruling. nah i guess the problem is just what the show has a problem with, her using it, and that the coming out story is out of context, without heed to the consequences there in the backwards place
